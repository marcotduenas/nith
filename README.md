Inspired by NotPron and Do Not Believe His Lies (DNBHL), I decided to create this game as a way to apply
the knowledge I gained from studying Java and Mobile Development (I even taught a class about it in high school).

# Which technologies were used

I've tought on using some framework like React Native or Flutter, but I've felt the necessity to use Java
because it was a programming language that I always wanted to work with.

# Installation
I'll release an apk soon as I have a playable game version. Besides that, my main goal is to publish this in the Play
Store as a way to make some bucks

# Contact

If you play the game or even finish it, please send me a feeback about your experience and  tell me
suggestions to improve the game.
